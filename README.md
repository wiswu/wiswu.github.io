 ## Wu-lcome!

###### You are one "wu wu wu dot wu is wu yu dot org"

We are challenging the unquestioned and archaic system of the English alphabet. One particularly frustrating fundamental linguistic issue with the English alphabet is the pronunciation of the letter "w".

The letter w is the only letter which has a name that describes it's appearance and we all know it's wrong to judge by appearance.

In German, "w" is pronounced "ve" and what rolls off the tongue smoother, "bee em double yu" or "bee em ve"?

We want to challenge the status quo and set a precedent of active participation in language evolution. Too many people accept language as it comes without questioning. Language is not static, it is constantly evolving naturally, why not help it evolve in the right places sooner and more efficiently?

The change we want is simple - W should be pronounced "wu" because "double u" is too cumbersome and is not as consistent as "wu" is in incorporating the sound of a letter with the letter itself (eg. a - aye, b - bee, c is not consistent etc.)

## Questions

 > Why is it even double u and not double v?

 > Isn't it cumbersome to say "double yu double yu double yu dot yada dot com" ? Some people might say "dub dub dub dot yada dot com" -- a preposterous double abbreviation.
